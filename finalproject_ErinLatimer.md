# Final Project Part I

## Outline & Initial Sketches
For my final project, I'd like to take a look at phone log data for my office, and use that data to tell the story that our office no longer needs to offer extended phone hours throughout a majority of the year. Our office has historicaly offered extended phone hours between December-early May, but over the last few years the number of phone calls in general has decreased due to efficiencies, technology, email outreach, LiveChat options, etc. Our current hours are a holdover, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to staff 5-7 pm Monday-Thursday during these months. In addition, with a light phone volume, the hours no longer seem necessary, and I'd like to use collected data to support my proposal of moving away from this daily expectation and rather offer specific dates/weeks that we offer extended hours rather than offering blanketed hours.

## Method & Medium
I intend to use Shorthand to display my final project, in order to tell the entire story. I'd like to talk about the background of why the practice is in place, as well as talk about some challenges or concerns with changing in order to address them directly and beforehand. Then I'd like to display data that supports making changes. Throughout all of this, I think Shorthand will provide me with the flexibility to both explain and visuaize. From what I gather, the tool has the ability to be both simple and powerful simultaneously. Because of the timeline that effects our call volume, I'm hoping shorthand may allow me to display that timeline like a story, for maximum impact.

## Audience/Motivation
My intended audience is my direct supervisor, the Dean of Admission here at Carnegie Mellon University. In addition, my colleague Greg, Director of Admission, will be folded into our conversation. Mike has been working within the office for over 40 years and his decisions are typically based on data. He's already very familiar with our call volume and I don't believe that he'll be surprised by what I share, so I wanted to do so in a succint manner that calls attention to specific points without allowing for opportunities to over-analyze. In addition, based on his busy schedule this will be a brief conversation, so the quicker I can get my point across and the easier I can allow him to interpret, the better, which is why I stuck to bar charts and line graphs.

We've been discussing the idea of changing how we approach extended on-call for some time, due to challenges faced by offering it. Counselors arrive two hours late in order to work this shift, so it isn't as much of a scheduling issue for them, however it is required. In addition to counselors working this shift, our operational Support Staff (my direct reports) answer these calls before transfering them to a counselor, and the shift is on a volunteer basis rather than required. Due to it requiring volunteers, many Support Staff elect not to assist, creating a burden on those who do. While counselors are rotated daily to help with extended hours and end up with no more than one shift every two weeks, the small size of the Support Staff causes them to work for a week of extended hours at a time and therefore having Fridays off during that week.

My motivation for wanting to take this analysis on was two-fold: 1. The Support Staff are my direct reports and I do my best to create efficiencies that allow them to do their jobs better or allow the office to conduct processes more efficiently. Eliminating "voluntary" extended hours will allow for both due to their increased happiness, productivity, and overall feeling heard based on the fact that call volume has dropped and there isn't such a need for the extended hours. 2. Calls have signficantly decreased, including during extended weeks, and we can better utilize our staff by not losing a Support Staffer on a busy Friday because they worked extended and can't work on a Friday.

I believe by offering an alternative that doesn't completely remove extended hours, but rather finds those continued needs and works effectively to highlight specific weeks, we'll accomplish all of our goals and meet mutual interests.

## Process/Reflection

Working on this project was interesting because I *hoped* the data and findings would support my interest in changing our approach to extended hours, but I ultimately didn't know until I took a deep dive into the data. There were many avenues to our phone data that I could have manipulated based on the plethora of data I had, and at times it was difficult to determine how far to go, what to use, and ultimately how I wanted to tell my story. I feel good about the data that I'm conveying, because it calls attention to the points I want to make, without leaving out other pieces of the story. For example I'm highlighting peak call times, but I'm not discounting that there are other higher call times too. A compromise I'm expecting to make is that during 2-3 lower peak call times we'll also offer extended. Either way, it'll cut down the weeks we offer it by at least half.

I also took the feedback I received both from the professor/TA and my user research group in order to present my data as a collection versus charts that didn't flow together and seemingly didn't belong together. I hope that's clearly conveyed in the style that I chose to present in. I used color in a limited manner to tie together each visualization but also not to overdo it where I don't need to.

One thing that I really appreciated about this process was the fact that between submitting part 1 and 2 I made changes, and likewise between parts 2 and 3 I made changes. Had I been asked to submit this only one time I don't think I would have been so reflective and thought about my process, which is ultimately building up to my story.
