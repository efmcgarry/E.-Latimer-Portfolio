# Final Project Part I

## Outline & Initial Sketches
For my final project, I'd like to take a look at phone log data for my office, and use that data to tell the story that our office no longer needs to offer extended phone hours throughout a majority of the year. Our office has historicaly offered extended phone hours between December-early May, but over the last few years the number of phone calls in general has decreased due to efficiencies, technology, email outreach, LiveChat options, etc. Our current hours are a holdover, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to staff 5-7 pm Monday-Thursday during these months. In addition, with a light phone volume, the hours no longer seem necessary, and I'd like to use collected data to support my proposal of moving away from this daily expectation and rather offer specific dates/weeks that we offer extended hours rather than offering blanketed hours.

## Method & Medium
I intend to use Shorthand to display my final project, in order to tell the entire story. I'd like to talk about the background of why the practice is in place, as well as talk about some challenges or concerns with changing in order to address them directly and beforehand. Then I'd like to display data that supports making changes. Throughout all of this, I think Shorthand will provide me with the flexibility to both explain and visuaize. From what I gather, the tool has the ability to be both simple and powerful simultaneously. Because of the timeline that effects our call volume, I'm hoping shorthand may allow me to display that timeline like a story, for maximum impact.
