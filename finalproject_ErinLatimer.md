# Final Project Part I

## Outline & Initial Sketches
For my final project, I'd like to take a look at phone log data for my office, and use that data to tell the story that our office no longer needs to offer extended phone hours throughout a majority of the year. Our office has historicaly offered extended phone hours between December-early May, but over the last few years the number of phone calls in general has decreased due to efficiencies, technology, email outreach, LiveChat options, etc. Our current hours are a holdover, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to staff 5-7 pm Monday-Thursday during these months. In addition, with a light phone volume, the hours no longer seem necessary, and I'd like to use collected data to support my proposal of moving away from this daily expectation and rather offer specific dates/weeks that we offer extended hours rather than offering blanketed hours.
