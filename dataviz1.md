I designed this Data Viz from the perspective of a USA Today data journalist. The newspaper offers streamlined infographics and data visualizations that are easily and quickly digestible without compromising quality and brand integrity. I experimented with multiple chart designs before ultimately landing on a grouped column and added in an infographic. I think at a quick glance, the reader would be able to tell from the chart that each of these populations has increased over the past year, and from the graphic they'd see that the increases have been fairly drastic. My intention was to have the viewer originally look at the chart to recognize the increase, but then draw their eye to the percentages and ideally shock them with how much changed over a one year period.

I think I may have used too many words in this visualization, but I was afraid the chart alone with percentages would have been too busy, and the infographic isn't as meaningful without the chart providing context. I went back and forth with color choices here. For the infographic, the use of yellow and red was intentional to serve as different level warnings and to ultimately shock the reader with the total increase. Even if they don't look at anything else, I hope they'd see the title of my chart, the drastic increase in family units being detained, and the red total increase infographic. I toyed with having the chart itself be shades of grey, but decided it looked less important than the infographic that way. The variants of the color blue are intended to show increase within the same variable.

I had a hard time with this visual. I imagine that if I were working for the Department of Homeland Security and I received this report from the Inspector General, I'd want to highlight this information in a positive light to reflect the fact that my employer was doing what's best, and frankly it's tough to think about this information positively. I chose to first demonstrate the large increase in those crossing the border, to therefore justify the increase in apprehensions between 2018 and 2019. Though I used a lot of the same stats from my previous perspective as a data journalist, by first displaying the increase in migration I downplayed the apprehensions as if they were clearly warranted based off of increases, in order to justify the data to my audience which is my government employer.

I utilized red to mean a caution here, and then chose grey for the chart in order not to draw attention. The second chart being smaller and less obvious was to make it look like it supported the original chart, and essentially that one would lead to the other.
