# The Nielsen Local Watch Report: Data Viz Critique
My immediate reaction was that this visualization shows a consistent growth in trend based on the visual. I appreciate that they used an infographic relevant to the topic at hand, as it resonates by viewing rather than reading. There's also good use of color that doesn't distract from the growing trend they're looking to highlight. The font was difficult for me to understand, and I at first interpreted 11 million as 1 million because the 1s ran into the M and somewhat resembled either the letter L or the letter i. Clearly, the scale is off here as the growth of one million exactly mirrors the growth of 4 million. I also felt that percentages rather than numbers would have been more useful to display growth. The population has grown in 8 years, but I don't think this visualization clearly showed that growth.

The organization who runs the website is a data and measurement firm who relies on the consumer to report back information, which they then report/display on their site. I think that the scale being used improperly here causes the reader to find a disconnect between the increase depicted and the increase understood upon digesting the information via reading.

Without the two follow-up questions, I wouldn't have been nearly as thoughtful in my critique. I would have taken a look at the visual, and then rated on a scale, and could have finished without having thought about my initial and final observations, what didn't work and what did, the use of font, values, colors, etc. I think open-ended questions are necessary with a critique. Whether it's those that you provided above, or under each rating scale we provide a quick mention of why we provided that rating, it forces us to justify why we chose what we did. Even with expanding upon ratings I worry that we'd still miss an initial reaction and that's what seems so critical with a data viz, to me at least. If I'm not initially understanding the data, or interested in understanding it, it didn't serve it's purpose, and the rating scales don't fully take hold of that importance.

I chose to focus on the percentages rather than the number of homes with cable TV, as I thought the percentages more accurately depicted growth. I stuck with the infographic idea, to display the number of households growing between 2012 and 2018. Since I was looking at the same variable, I used a color variation rather than contrasting colors to display the increase over time. I also used more easy to read text to avoid confusion. I'm curious if there's a differince in effectiveness when displaying as it currently is where you click between, vs a display with the most recent data as an infographic underneath the original.
