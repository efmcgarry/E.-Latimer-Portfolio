# E.-Latimer-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course with the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon.

# About Me
My name is Erin Latimer and I'm a student in the MPM Program through Heinz College. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm completing the program part-time while I work full-time on campus in the Office of Admission. I'm on the long-term track in the program, as I'll be having my first child in October, but I'm planning to graduate in under 5 years!

# What I hope to learn...
I'm looking forward to using what I learn in this class to better depict visuals required for my role, and to use them as support when proposing changes within the office. There isn't a specific type of visual I'm looking to learn about, rather I'm interested in presenting information in a different way, which could potentially be influential in enforcing a new idea. My office is a data-driven office, which really motivated me in choosing this course specifically.

I chose to focus most heavily on Corbyn by graying out the opposition, and highlighting only his likes. I also changed the title to more closely align with what was being represented. I was unable to italicize and add a key to describe the political parties vs. the candidates, and I would have explained that more thoroughly if possible. I'm glad that this representation more clearly depicts the vast difference in likes between Corbyn and the other parties, as it's important to note. I wasn't sure if we could delete information here, because I probably would have deleted the political parties to only focus on the candidates specifically.

## Data Viz Critique #2: The Nielsen Local Watch Report
My immediate reaction was that this visualization shows a consistent growth in trend based on the visual. I appreciate that they used an infographic relevant to the topic at hand, as it resonates by viewing rather than reading. There's also good use of color that doesn't distract from the growing trend they're looking to highlight. The font was difficult for me to understand, and I at first interpreted 11 million as 1 million because the 1s ran into the M and somewhat resembled either the letter L or the letter i. Clearly, the scale is off here as the growth of one million exactly mirrors the growth of 4 million. I also felt that percentages rather than numbers would have been more useful to display growth. The population has grown in 8 years, but I don't think this visualization clearly showed that growth.

The organization who runs the website is a data and measurement firm who relies on the consumer to report back information, which they then report/display on their site. I think that the scale being used improperly here causes the reader to find a disconnect between the increase depicted and the increase understood upon digesting the information via reading.

Without the two follow-up questions, I wouldn't have been nearly as thoughtful in my critique. I would have taken a look at the visual, and then rated on a scale, and could have finished without having thought about my initial and final observations, what didn't work and what did, the use of font, values, colors, etc. I think open-ended questions are necessary with a critique. Whether it's those that you provided above, or under each rating scale we provide a quick mention of why we provided that rating, it forces us to justify why we chose what we did. Even with expanding upon ratings I worry that we'd still miss an initial reaction and that's what seems so critical with a data viz, to me at least. If I'm not initially understanding the data, or interested in understanding it, it didn't serve it's purpose, and the rating scales don't fully take hold of that importance.

I chose to focus on the percentages rather than the number of homes with cable TV, as I thought the percentages more accurately depicted growth. I stuck with the infographic idea, to display the number of households growing between 2012 and 2018. Since I was looking at the same variable, I used a color variation rather than contrasting colors to display the increase over time. I also used more easy to read text to avoid confusion. I'm curious if there's a differince in effectiveness when displaying as it currently is where you click between, vs a display with the most recent data as an infographic underneath the original.

I designed this Data Viz from the perspective of a USA Today data journalist. The newspaper offers streamlined infographics and data visualizations that are easily and quickly digestible without compromising quality and brand integrity. I experimented with multiple chart designs before ultimately landing on a grouped column and added in an infographic. I think at a quick glance, the reader would be able to tell from the chart that each of these populations has increased over the past year, and from the graphic they'd see that the increases have been fairly drastic. My intention was to have the viewer originally look at the chart to recognize the increase, but then draw their eye to the percentages and ideally shock them with how much changed over a one year period.

I think I may have used too many words in this visualization, but I was afraid the chart alone with percentages would have been too busy, and the infographic isn't as meaningful without the chart providing context. I went back and forth with color choices here. For the infographic, the use of yellow and red was intentional to serve as different level warnings and to ultimately shock the reader with the total increase. Even if they don't look at anything else, I hope they'd see the title of my chart, the drastic increase in family units being detained, and the red total increase infographic. I toyed with having the chart itself be shades of grey, but decided it looked less important than the infographic that way. The variants of the color blue are intended to show increase within the same variable.

I had a hard time with this visual. I imagine that if I were working for the Department of Homeland Security and I received this report from the Inspector General, I'd want to highlight this information in a positive light to reflect the fact that my employer was doing what's best, and frankly it's tough to think about this information positively. I chose to first demonstrate the large increase in those crossing the border, to therefore justify the increase in apprehensions between 2018 and 2019. Though I used a lot of the same stats from my previous perspective as a data journalist, by first displaying the increase in migration I downplayed the apprehensions as if they were clearly warranted based off of increases, in order to justify the data to my audience which is my government employer.

I utilized red to mean a caution here, and then chose grey for the chart in order not to draw attention. The second chart being smaller and less obvious was to make it look like it supported the original chart, and essentially that one would lead to the other.

### Outline & Initial Sketches
For my final project, I'd like to take a look at phone log data for my office, and use that data to tell the story that our office no longer needs to offer extended phone hours throughout a majority of the year. Our office has historicaly offered extended phone hours between December-early May, but over the last few years the number of phone calls in general has decreased due to efficiencies, technology, email outreach, LiveChat options, etc. Our current hours are a holdover, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to staff 5-7 pm Monday-Thursday during these months. In addition, with a light phone volume, the hours no longer seem necessary, and I'd like to use collected data to support my proposal of moving away from this daily expectation and rather offer specific dates/weeks that we offer extended hours rather than offering blanketed hours.

### Data

### Method & Medium
I intend to use Shorthand to display my final project, in order to tell the entire story. I'd like to talk about the background of why the practice is in place, as well as talk about some challenges or concerns with changing in order to address them directly and beforehand. Then I'd like to display data that supports making changes. Throughout all of this, I think Shorthand will provide me with the flexibility to both explain and visuaize. From what I gather, the tool has the ability to be both simple and powerful simultaneously. Because of the timeline that effects our call volume, I'm hoping shorthand may allow me to display that timeline like a story, for maximum impact.
