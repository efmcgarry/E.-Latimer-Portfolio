# E.-Latimer-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course with the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon.

# About Me
My name is Erin Latimer and I'm a student in the MPM Program through Heinz College. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm completing the program part-time while I work full-time on campus in the Office of Admission. I'm on the long-term track in the program, as I'll be having my first child in October, but I'm planning to graduate in under 5 years!

# What I hope to learn...
I'm looking forward to using what I learn in this class to better depict visuals required for my role, and to use them as support when proposing changes within the office. My office is a data-driven office, which really motivated me in choosing this course specifically.

I chose to focus most heavily on Corbyn by graying out the opposition, and highlighting only his likes. I also changed the title to more closely align with what was being represented. I was unable to italicize and add a key to describe the political parties vs. the candidates, and I would have explained that more thoroughly if possible. I'm glad that this representation more clearly depicts the vast difference in likes between Corbyn and the other parties, as it's important to note. I wasn't sure if we could delete information here, because I probably would have deleted the political parties to only focus on the candidates specifically.

More to come soon!
