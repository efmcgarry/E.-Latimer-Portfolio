# E.-Latimer-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course with the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon.

# About Me
My name is Erin Latimer and I'm a student in the MPM Program through Heinz College. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm completing the program part-time while I work full-time on campus in the Office of Admission. I'm on the long-term track in the program, as I'll be having my first child in October, but I'm planning to graduate in under 5 years!

# What I hope to learn...
I'm looking forward to using what I learn in this class to better depict visuals required for my role, and to use them as support when proposing changes within the office. There isn't a specific type of visual I'm looking to learn about, rather I'm interested in presenting information in a different way, which could potentially be influential in enforcing a new idea. My office is a data-driven office, which really motivated me in choosing this course specifically.
