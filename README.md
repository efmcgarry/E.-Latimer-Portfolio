# E.-Latimer-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course with the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon.

# About Me
My name is Erin Latimer and I'm a student in the MPM Program through Heinz College. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I'm completing the program part-time while I work full-time on campus in the Office of Admission. I'm on the long-term track in the program, as I'll be having my first child in October, but I'm planning to graduate in under 5 years!

# What I hope to learn...
I'm looking forward to using what I learn in this class to better depict visuals required for my role, and to use them as support when proposing changes within the office. There isn't a specific type of visual I'm looking to learn about, rather I'm interested in presenting information in a different way, which could potentially be influential in enforcing a new idea. My office is a data-driven office, which really motivated me in choosing this course specifically.

I chose to focus most heavily on Corbyn by graying out the opposition, and highlighting only his likes. I also changed the title to more closely align with what was being represented. I was unable to italicize and add a key to describe the political parties vs. the candidates, and I would have explained that more thoroughly if possible. I'm glad that this representation more clearly depicts the vast difference in likes between Corbyn and the other parties, as it's important to note. I wasn't sure if we could delete information here, because I probably would have deleted the political parties to only focus on the candidates specifically.

## Data Viz Critique #2: The Nielsen Local Watch Report
My immediate reaction was that this visualization shows a consistent growth in trend based on the visual. I appreciate that they used an infographic relevant to the topic at hand, as it resonates by viewing rather than reading. There's also good use of color that doesn't distract from the growing trend they're looking to highlight. The font was difficult for me to understand, and I at first interpreted 11 million as 1 million because the 1s ran into the M and somewhat resembled either the letter L or the letter i. Clearly, the scale is off here as the growth of one million exactly mirrors the growth of 4 million. I also felt that percentages rather than numbers would have been more useful to display growth. The population has grown in 8 years, but I don't think this visualization clearly showed that growth.

The organization who runs the website is a data and measurement firm who relies on the consumer to report back information, which they then report/display on their site. I think that the scale being used improperly here causes the reader to find a disconnect between the increase depicted and the increase understood upon digesting the information via reading.

Without the two follow-up questions, I wouldn't have been nearly as thoughtful in my critique. I would have taken a look at the visual, and then rated on a scale, and could have finished without having thought about my initial and final observations, what didn't work and what did, the use of font, values, colors, etc. I think open-ended questions are necessary with a critique. Whether it's those that you provided above, or under each rating scale we provide a quick mention of why we provided that rating, it forces us to justify why we chose what we did. Even with expanding upon ratings I worry that we'd still miss an initial reaction and that's what seems so critical with a data viz, to me at least. If I'm not initially understanding the data, or interested in understanding it, it didn't serve it's purpose, and the rating scales don't fully take hold of that importance.

I chose to focus on the percentages rather than the number of homes with cable TV, as I thought the percentages more accurately depicted growth. I stuck with the infographic idea, to display the number of households growing between 2012 and 2018. Since I was looking at the same variable, I used a color variation rather than contrasting colors to display the increase over time. I also used more easy to read text to avoid confusion. I'm curious if there's a differince in effectiveness when displaying as it currently is where you click between, vs a display with the most recent data as an infographic underneath the original.
